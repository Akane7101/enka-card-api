# enka-card-api
This project combines the following Python Enka card image generation scripts into an intuitive API to use:  
- [EnkaCard](https://github.com/DEViantUA/EnkaCard)
- [StarRailCard](https://github.com/DEViantUA/StarRailCard)

## Side Notes
- This is made for [Hoyo Buddy](https://github.com/seriaati/hoyo-buddy).
- See all the endpoints and schemas in `main.py`, or run the API and go to `/docs`.
- I am not hosting this API anywhere, you'd need to clone this repo and host it locally on your machine.
- Run `main.py` to start the API, run `update.py` to update assets.
